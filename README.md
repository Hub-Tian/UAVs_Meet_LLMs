## Introduction
This repository accompanies our work on **"UAVs Meet LLMs: Overviews and Perspectives Toward Agentic Low-Altitude Mobility"**.  
Here, we primarily store various **tables** referenced in the survey/overview paper. These tables focus on:

- Summarization of **LLMs, VLMs, and VFMs**  
- Summaries of **Methods and Models**  
- **UAV-oriented Datasets** across multiple application domains

> **Note**: The goal is to provide a structured, easy-to-navigate resource for researchers interested in the intersection of UAVs and Large Language Models.
