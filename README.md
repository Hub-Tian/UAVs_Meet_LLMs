## üî•üî•üî• News
- **[2024-12-27]** This repository is newly launched to explore the synergy between **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. We will continually update it with fresh papers, demos, and insights.

> If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/Hub-Tian/UAVs_Meet_LLMs/issues) or contact us via email.

## Introduction
This repository accompanies our work on **"UAVs Meet LLMs: Overviews and Perspectives Toward Agentic Low-Altitude Mobility"**.  
Here, we primarily store various **tables** referenced in the survey/overview paper. These tables focus on:

- Summarization of **LLMs, VLMs, and VFMs**  
- Summaries of **Methods and Models**  
- **UAV-oriented Datasets** across multiple application domains

> **Note**: The goal is to provide a structured, easy-to-navigate resource for researchers interested in the intersection of UAVs and Large Language Models.
